This is a personal project which I created to showcase some of the projects that I made during my journey through the Scrimba course [Learn React For Free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

This project also served me as an exercise to put in practice everything that I learned in the [Introduction course](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) about Nextjs offered by Vercel.

I really learned a lot while making this project, and now I feel that my general understanding of React and Nextjs has improved substantially.

You can check out more info about me and some of my other projects on my [portifolio](https://daniel-oliveira1401.github.io/).
